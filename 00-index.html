		<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx">TEDx</a>. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxTufts, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxTufts event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

			<h3 class="centered-text">Our History</h3>
			<p>Before TEDxTufts, there was the Tufts Idea Exchange (or TEX). The Tufts Idea Exchange was a TED-style night of Tufts student, faculty, and alumni/ae speakers sharing their brightest, most innovative ideas with the community. TEX showcased the innovative and creative potential of this university- entirely independent from TEDx. After five successful years of TEX, we've decided to try TEDx and bring our unique tradition of TEX to a new stage. </p>

			<h3 class="centered-text">The Event</h3>
			<p>
			TEDxTufts serves as a catalyst for connecting provocative thinkers with provocative doers, by showcasing the ideas, stories, and experiences of those in the Tufts community. Our first event was held on April 17th, 2015. To view videos from the event, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsRNoUx8w3rMQb9cJlMsiV9S-9CEgazt0">click here</a>!  </p>
