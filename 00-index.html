		<h3 class="centered-text">What's TEDx?</h3>
		<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx">TEDx</a>. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxTufts, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxTufts event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

		<div class="medium-4 columns">
			<h3 class="centered-text">Our History</h3>
			<p>Before TEDxTufts, there was the Tufts Idea Exchange (or TEX). The Tufts Idea Exchange was a TED-style night of Tufts student, faculty, and alumni/ae speakers sharing their brightest, most innovative ideas with the community. TEX showcased the innovative and creative potential of this university- entirely independent from TEDx. After five successful years of TEX, we've decided to try TEDx and bring our unique tradition of TEX to a new stage. </p>

			<h3 class="centered-text">The Event</h3>
			<p>
			TEDxTufts serves as a catalyst for connecting provocative thinkers with provocative doers, by showcasing the ideas, stories, and experiences of those in the Tufts community. The event will be a one night event in April 2015, date to be announced soon!  </p>
