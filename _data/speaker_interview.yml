     age: 22
     gender: She series
     affiliation: I’m a senior at Tufts, and in a few months I’ll be following in the footsteps of my brother Peter who graduated from here in 2012!
     home: Princeton, New Jersey
     reason: Instead of talking about art in the context of Art History, TEDxTufts provides a platform for a community conversation that’s larger than any one discipline. I want to share the work I’ve done studying Medieval art objects in a way that conveys passion, but also relatability. I’m also excited to speak because it’s pretty out of my comfort zone.
     perfectDay: Any day that starts with coffee and ends with a good book.
     funFact: I first applied to Tufts as a natural science major. Sophomore year when I switched to Art History, it felt like a different world. What I’ve realized is that the sciences are much more relatable to the humanities than department divisions make it feel. And the coolest moments and most memorable conversations I’ve had are ones that ignore disciplinary boundaries.
     gift: My family spent hundreds of hours over the past four years travelling to my field hockey games. The support and time they put towards something I love so much was the most meaningful gift I’ve ever received. I am so thankful to have shared my career with them.
     exciting: I’m excited for next year. I have no idea what I’ll be doing, and I’ve loved my time at Tufts, but I’m feeling ready to graduate and explore a new time in life.
     jam: Anything off Watch the Throne or The Black Album
