   bio: Beth has spent the last 20+ years helping brands in both the private and public sector bridge the gap between their offering and their consumers’ needs – creating products and services that reflect these needs and then marketing them in a way that resonates and inspires action. Most recently she was with C Space (formerly known as Communispace) and consulted with Fortune 500 companies including Hewlett Packard, Charles Schwab and Weight Watchers and helped them understand how to make their brand, products and services relevant to the people they serve (including current and prospective customers, partners and employees). Beth has spent most of her career working in entrepreneurial environments including the years she ran her own consulting business and her 11+ years at C Space (which in her tenure grew from 30 to 600+ employees; she was instrumental in establishing and growing relationships with clients, recruiting, developing and inspiring employees; and defining and executing overall growth strategies). For nearly as long a time, Beth has been an advocate for education – as a volunteer, as a consultant and as a lecturer. She has collaborated with students at several Boston area colleges and universities and enjoys immensely the opportunity to inspire people – challenging them to think in new ways and knowing that the work she's doing is making a difference.
